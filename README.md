# Metro Vancouver 9-1-1 Emergency Reporting System
This project was created for the final project of CMPT 272 Fall 2024. The project's goal was to replace the legacy system with a modern and user-friendly, web-based emergency reporting system designed for Metro Vancouver's E-Comm 9-1-1 service. The system allows civilians to report emergencies, operators to manage and resolve reports, and provides a map-based interface for better situational awareness.

## üöÄ Project Overview
E-Comm handles over one million emergency calls annually. Our system bridges the gap between the public and first responders by enabling users to:
- Submit emergency reports with details such as the nature of the emergency, location, and additional comments.
- View all active emergency reports on an interactive map with markers.
- See an up-to-date, sortable list of reports synchronized with the map's zoom and pan.
- Review emergency details by interacting with map markers or list items.
- Modify or delete reports (with valid passcode authorization).
The platform is built with usability and functionality in mind, offering real-time feedback, secure passcode verification using MD5 hashing, and seamless storage with the DOM Storage API.
